# Run covid19app on your phone now!

# BEWARE: Tested only on Pixel 3 for now. Help please!

Mobile app(s) to fight coronavirus! Participate with your symptoms.
Help spread the load to labs and hospitals. Give recommendation. And more!


#### Try it today!

* Use the tab `Health` to submit symptoms. Server response contains action of what to do.
  Currently only fever over 37.5 C (= 99.5 F) send you to hospital. Other symptoms are ignored for now.
* When you come to lab you will show `QR Code` tab.
* The person taking your swab will work with `Pair` tab (which obviously should be separate app).
  She scans your qr code and testkit code and click "Submit".
* Lab assistant will use tab `Lab` (which obviously should be separate app).
  She scans the testkit code and enters lab test result.
* You will recieve test result to `Next Steps` tab once the lab enters it to the app.

Note: It may crash at start. It is some caching issue of expo. Just try it once more please.
